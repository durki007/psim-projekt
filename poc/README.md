# Proof Of Concept

ResNet based model, finetuned on CheXpert dataset and using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping for XAI.

## Requirements
1. CheXpert dataset downloaded locally
2. Python and pytorch

## Description

**Models, wrappers and datasets** are defined in folder `src`

**Proof of concept** is the notebook `resnet_chexpert.ipynb`, includes training code, evaluation and CAM example.
